# Best-shopping-deal
DESCRIPTION 

For this project you'll be writing a program to help me get the best deals on my shopping list. I've gathered the inventories of a few local stores, so I can track what items they have in stock and how much they are selling things for. With that information (and knowing what I need to purchase), I can assemble a list of what I need to purchase from each location.  <br /><br />

 

Here's the format for the stores' inventories: <br />
